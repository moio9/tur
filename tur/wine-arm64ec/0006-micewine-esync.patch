++This is eventfd-based synchronization, or 'esync' for short. Turn it on with
++WINEESYNC=1; debug it with +esync.
++
++== BUGS AND LIMITATIONS ==
++
++Please let me know if you find any bugs. If you can, also attach a log with
+++seh,+pid,+esync,+server,+timestamp.
++
++If you get something like "eventfd: Too many open files" and then things start
++crashing, you've probably run out of file descriptors. esync creates one
++eventfd descriptor for each synchronization object, and some games may use a
++large number of these.  Linux by default limits a process to 4096 file
++descriptors, which probably was reasonable back in the nineties but isn't
++really anymore. (Fortunately Debian and derivatives [Ubuntu, Mint] already
++have a reasonable limit.) To raise the limit you'll want to edit
++/etc/security/limits.conf and add a line like
++
++* hard nofile 1048576
++
++then restart your session.
++
++On distributions using systemd, the settings in `/etc/security/limits.conf`
++will be overridden by systemd's own settings. If you run `ulimit -Hn` and it
++returns a lower number than the one you've previously set, then you can set
++
++DefaultLimitNOFILE=1048576
++
++in both `/etc/systemd/system.conf` and `/etc/systemd/user.conf`. You can then
++execute `sudo systemctl daemon-reexec` and restart your session. Check again
++with `ulimit -Hn` that the limit is correct.
++
++Also note that if the wineserver has esync active, all clients also must, and
++vice versa. Otherwise things will probably crash quite badly.
++
++== EXPLANATION ==
++
++The aim is to execute all synchronization operations in "user-space", that is,
++without going through wineserver. We do this using Linux's eventfd
++facility. The main impetus to using eventfd is so that we can poll multiple
++objects at once; in particular we can't do this with futexes, or pthread
++semaphores, or the like. The only way I know of to wait on any of multiple
++objects is to use select/poll/epoll to wait on multiple fds, and eventfd gives
++us those fds in a quite usable way.
++
++Whenever a semaphore, event, or mutex is created, we have the server, instead
++of creating a traditional server-side event/semaphore/mutex, instead create an
++'esync' primitive. These live in esync.c and are very slim objects; in fact,
++they don't even know what type of primitive they are. The server is involved
++at all because we still need a way of creating named objects, passing handles
++to another process, etc.
++
++The server creates an eventfd file descriptor with the requested parameters
++and passes it back to ntdll. ntdll creates an object of the appropriate type,
++then caches it in a table. This table is copied almost wholesale from the fd
++cache code in server.c.
++
++Specific operations follow quite straightforwardly from eventfd:
++
++* To release an object, or set an event, we simply write() to it.
++* An object is signalled if read() succeeds on it. Notably, we create all
++  eventfd descriptors with O_NONBLOCK, so that we can atomically check if an
++  object is signalled and grab it if it is. This also lets us reset events.
++* For objects whose state should not be reset upon waiting—e.g. manual-reset
++  events—we simply check for the POLLIN flag instead of reading.
++* Semaphores are handled by the EFD_SEMAPHORE flag. This matches up quite well
++  (although with some difficulties; see below).
++* Mutexes store their owner thread locally. This isn't reliable information if
++  a different process's thread owns the mutex, but this doesn't matter—a
++  thread should only care whether it owns the mutex, so it knows whether to
++  try waiting on it or simply to increase the recursion count.
++
++The interesting part about esync is that (almost) all waits happen in ntdll,
++including those on server-bound objects. The idea here is that on the server
++side, for any waitable object, we create an eventfd file descriptor (not an
++esync primitive), and then pass it to ntdll if the program tries to wait on
++it. These are cached too, so only the first wait will require a round trip to
++the server. Then the server signals the file descriptor as appropriate, and
++thereby wakes up the client. So far this is implemented for processes,
++threads, message queues (difficult; see below), and device managers (necessary
++for drivers to work). All of these are necessarily server-bound, so we
++wouldn't really gain anything by signalling on the client side instead. Of
++course, except possibly for message queues, it's not likely that any program
++(cutting-edge D3D game or not) is going to be causing a great wineserver load
++by waiting on any of these objects; the motivation was rather to provide a way
++to wait on ntdll-bound and server-bound objects at the same time.
++
++Some cases are still passed to the server, and there's probably no reason not
++to keep them that way. Those that I noticed while testing include: async
++objects, which are internal to the file APIs and never exposed to userspace,
++startup_info objects, which are internal to the loader and signalled when a
++process starts, and keyed events, which are exposed through an ntdll API
++(although not through kernel32) but can't be mixed with other objects (you
++have to use NtWaitForKeyedEvent()). Other cases include: named pipes, debug
++events, sockets, and timers. It's unlikely we'll want to optimize debug events
++or sockets (or any of the other, rather rare, objects), but it is possible
++we'll want to optimize named pipes or timers.
++
++There were two sort of complications when working out the above. The first one
++was events. The trouble is that (1) the server actually creates some events by
++itself and (2) the server sometimes manipulates events passed by the
++client. Resolving the first case was easy enough, and merely entailed creating
++eventfd descriptors for the events the same way as for processes and threads
++(note that we don't really lose anything this way; the events include
++"LowMemoryCondition" and the event that signals system processes to shut
++down). For the second case I basically had to hook the server-side event
++functions to redirect to esync versions if the event was actually an esync
++primitive.
++
++The second complication was message queues. The difficulty here is that X11
++signals events by writing into a pipe (at least I think it's a pipe?), and so
++as a result wineserver has to poll on that descriptor. In theory we could just
++let wineserver do so and then signal us as appropriate, except that wineserver
++only polls on the pipe when the thread is waiting for events (otherwise we'd
++get e.g. keyboard input while the thread is doing something else, and spin
++forever trying to wake up a thread that doesn't care). The obvious solution is
++just to poll on that fd ourselves, and that's what I did—it's just that
++getting the fd from wineserver was kind of ugly, and the code for waiting was
++also kind of ugly basically because we have to wait on both X11's fd and the
++"normal" process/thread-style wineserver fd that we use to signal sent
++messages. The upshot about the whole thing was that races are basically
++impossible, since a thread can only wait on its own queue.
++
++System APCs already work, since the server will forcibly suspend a thread if
++it's not already waiting, and so we just need to check for EINTR from
++poll(). User APCs and alertable waits are implemented in a similar style to
++message queues (well, sort of): whenever someone executes an alertable wait,
++we add an additional eventfd to the list, which the server signals when an APC
++arrives. If that eventfd gets signaled, we hand it off to the server to take
++care of, and return STATUS_USER_APC.
++
++Originally I kept the volatile state of semaphores and mutexes inside a
++variable local to the handle, with the knowledge that this would break if
++someone tried to open the handle elsewhere or duplicate it. It did, and so now
++this state is stored inside shared memory. This is of the POSIX variety, is
++allocated by the server (but never mapped there) and lives under the path
++"/wine-esync".
++
++There are a couple things that this infrastructure can't handle, although
++surprisingly there aren't that many. In particular:
++* Implementing wait-all, i.e. WaitForMultipleObjects(..., TRUE, ...), is not
++  exactly possible the way we'd like it to be possible. In theory that
++  function should wait until it knows all objects are available, then grab
++  them all at once atomically. The server (like the kernel) can do this
++  because the server is single-threaded and can't race with itself. We can't
++  do this in ntdll, though. The approach I've taken I've laid out in great
++  detail in the relevant patch, but for a quick summary we poll on each object
++  until it's signaled (but don't grab it), check them all again, and if
++  they're all signaled we try to grab them all at once in a tight loop, and if
++  we fail on any of them we reset the count on whatever we shouldn't have
++  consumed. Such a blip would necessarily be very quick.
++* The whole patchset only works on Linux, where eventfd is available. However,
++  it should be possible to make it work on a Mac, since eventfd is just a
++  quicker, easier way to use pipes (i.e. instead of writing 1 to the fd you'd
++  write 1 byte; instead of reading a 64-bit value from the fd you'd read as
++  many bytes as you can carry, which is admittedly less than 2**64 but
++  can probably be something reasonable.) It's also possible, although I
++  haven't yet looked, to use some different kind of synchronization
++  primitives, but pipes would be easiest to tack onto this framework.
++* PulseEvent() can't work the way it's supposed to work. Fortunately it's rare
++  and deprecated. It's also explicitly mentioned on MSDN that a thread can
++  miss the notification for a kernel APC, so in a sense we're not necessarily
++  doing anything wrong.
++
++There are some things that are perfectly implementable but that I just haven't
++done yet:
++* Other synchronizable server primitives. It's unlikely we'll need any of
++  these, except perhaps named pipes (which would honestly be rather difficult)
++  and (maybe) timers.
++* Access masks. We'd need to store these inside ntdll, and validate them when
++  someone tries to execute esync operations.
++
++This patchset was inspired by Daniel Santos' "hybrid synchronization"
++patchset. My idea was to create a framework whereby even contended waits could
++be executed in userspace, eliminating a lot of the complexity that his
++synchronization primitives used. I do however owe some significant gratitude
++toward him for setting me on the right path.
++
++I've tried to maximize code separation, both to make any potential rebases
++easier and to ensure that esync is only active when configured. All code in
++existing source files is guarded with "if (do_esync())", and generally that
++condition is followed by "return esync_version_of_this_method(...);", where
++the latter lives in esync.c and is declared in esync.h. I've also tried to
++make the patchset very clear and readable—to write it as if I were going to
++submit it upstream. (Some intermediate patches do break things, which Wine is
++generally against, but I think it's for the better in this case.) I have cut
++some corners, though; there is some error checking missing, or implicit
++assumptions that the program is behaving correctly.
++
++I've tried to be careful about races. There are a lot of comments whose
++purpose are basically to assure me that races are impossible. In most cases we
++don't have to worry about races since all of the low-level synchronization is
++done by the kernel.
++
++Anyway, yeah, this is esync. Use it if you like.

++ * manual-reset events we don't, which means that the shm state can be out of
++ * sync with the actual state.
++ *
++ * In general we shouldn't have to worry about races between modifying the
++ * event and waiting on it. If the state changes while we're waiting, it's
++ * equally plausible that we caught it before or after the state changed.
++ * However, we can have races between SetEvent() and ResetEvent(), so that the
++ * event has inconsistent internal state.
++ *
++ * To solve this we have to use the other field to lock the event. Currently
++ * this is implemented as a spinlock, but I'm not sure if a futex might be
++ * better. I'm also not sure if it's possible to obviate locking by arranging
++ * writes and reads in a certain way.
++ *
++ * Note that we don't have to worry about locking in esync_wait_objects().
++ * There's only two general patterns:
++ *
++ * WaitFor()    SetEvent()
++ * -------------------------
++ * read()
++ * signaled = 0
++ *              signaled = 1
++ *              write()
++ * -------------------------
++ * read()
++ *              signaled = 1
++ * signaled = 0
++ *              <no write(), because it was already signaled>
++ * -------------------------
++ *
++ * That is, if SetEvent() tries to signal the event before WaitFor() resets its
++ * signaled state, it won't bother trying to write(), and then the signaled
++ * state will be reset, so the result is a consistent non-signaled event.
++ * There's several variations to this pattern but all of them are protected in
++ * the same way. Note however this is why we have to use interlocked_xchg()
++ * event inside of the lock.
++ */
++
++/* Removing this spinlock is harder than it looks. esync_wait_objects() can
++ * deal with inconsistent state well enough, and a race between SetEvent() and
++ * ResetEvent() gives us license to yield either result as long as we act
++ * consistently, but that's not enough. Notably, esync_wait_objects() should
++ * probably act like a fence, so that the second half of esync_set_event() does
++ * not seep past a subsequent reset. That's one problem, but no guarantee there
